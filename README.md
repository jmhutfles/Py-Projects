This software can be used to assess the performnace of a flying system using GPS data.

Usually this is flawed because there is no accounting for winds. This uses two GPS units. One is on a balistic jumper or windpack device and the other is on the system which is being measured. Run the "Wind Compensation.py" file and follow the prompts.
