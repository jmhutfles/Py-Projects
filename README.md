This is a growing collection of data analysis tools.

Wind correction
    This tool lets you use GPS data to calculate GLide
    
    Usually this is flawed because there is no accounting for winds. This uses two GPS units. One is on a balistic jumper or windpack device and the other is on the system which is being measured. Run Wind Compensation and follow the prompts.

    This is assuming you will use a 3rd party software ie. FLy Sight Viewer to look at the results graphically
